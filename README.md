# PURPOSE
This project is to make a better camera control system for the courses on Campus De Nayer (Computer Graphics).
Currently the students need to move the camera with the x/y/z , u/v/w and i/j/k keys, and if you ever used this approach,
you know it can be complicated. This is why this project exist.
You can now control the camera with z/q/s/d or w/a/s/d (or change the defines) to walk around an with a and e you can fly up or down.
Ofcourse all these keys van be changed in the config file.
This project will also take care of the rendering of the 'world' and rescaling.
